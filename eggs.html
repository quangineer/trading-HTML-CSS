                Our "eggs", right now, are considered a shelter for economic turmoil.
                What is better than putting money in one of the top notch financial institutions of Uncle Sam? Adjusting P/E, P/B, and being supported by BRK.A ? Yes, You are hearing it right!!! Buffet holds it and we hold it too. 
                Without any further due, let us introduce Citigroup (ticker C) to all of you. Good dividend, strong financial statement, oversold, too cheap to ignore, all time low within the last 5 years.

            <p> The second ticker is Delta Airline (ticker DAL). This is the biggest player in the airline industry of the USA. Their airline fleet is also the largest in term of quantity and the volume of flight is also ranked number one.</p>

            <p> It would have been a mistake if the inclusiveness of an ETF were not mentioned. In light of risks, we will not pick Cathie Wood's product nor Chinese products. We pick Indian Economy (ticker INDA). The second largest population country has a resilient attribute to any turmoil of the global crisis. Cheap labour, cheap material, high end technology, cleverness, good administration from government are some of their edge.</p>
