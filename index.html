        Until recently, the term recession and crisis rampantly pop up on
        mainstream media as well as social media. It is considered a contagious
        impact coming right after the 2020 Crash in light of Covid-19. According
        to people familiar with the matter telling the author that there is, by
        all means, no crisis at all. Why is that? The lesson of 2008 crisis and
        tech bubbles in early 2000 taught institutions, FED, and economy how to
        defense and reinforce assets in a more and more conservative way.
        Besides, the stress test for borrowings, including but not limited to
        mortgages, business loan and personal loans have been designed and
        updated quarterly to help banks thrive in the most fierce economic
        environment.

        There is a recession happening now. A hire freeze over many leading
        companies is really weighing on the economy. That is actually the nature
        of a economic body to defense itself from hazardous factors such as
        inflation, rate hikes, oil surge, war crime, and more.
