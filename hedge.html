            Hedge is not Hedgehogs or Purdy's chocolate hedgehogs sweeties on Kingsway and Earles. This is how we protect our portfolio. Headwind is what we expect no matter what. Tailwind is a bliss as always but hedge maybe the 9th wonder of the world after interest rate compound.

                We guarantee a monthly passive income from sell call OTM as well as sell put at the least risky strike price.

                And in a downslide market, we open our margin power to short shares and buy put to balance out our portfolio. We can also copy cat trade plans of Warren Buffet and Charlie Munger under Michael Blurry supervision.
